{"id":"personal-site-4zh","title":"[P2] Normalize mixed .js/.jsx file extensions in src/ to all .jsx","description":"## Problem\n\nThe CRA→Vite migration renamed most `.js` files to `.jsx`, but 13 files in `src/` still use the `.js` extension despite containing JSX or being React-related modules. This inconsistency makes it harder to apply consistent tooling rules.\n\n## Files to Rename (.js → .jsx)\n\nThese files should be renamed to `.jsx` for consistency (they are all React-related code):\n\n```\nsrc/utils/payloadApi.js          → src/utils/payloadApi.jsx\nsrc/content_option.js            → src/content_option.jsx (only if it exports JSX; if pure data, .js is fine)\nsrc/hooks/usePrefetch.js         → src/hooks/usePrefetch.jsx\nsrc/utils/videoProxy.js          → src/utils/videoProxy.jsx (only if it uses JSX)\nsrc/hooks/useDataPrefetch.js     → src/hooks/useDataPrefetch.jsx\nsrc/utils/videoHelper.js         → src/utils/videoHelper.jsx (only if it uses JSX)\nsrc/utils/cdnHelper.js           → src/utils/cdnHelper.jsx (only if it uses JSX)\nsrc/hooks/usePerformance.js      → src/hooks/usePerformance.jsx\nsrc/hooks/useTheme.js            → src/hooks/useTheme.jsx\nsrc/components/LoadingSpinner/index.js → src/components/LoadingSpinner/index.jsx\n```\n\n**IMPORTANT RULE**: Only rename to `.jsx` if the file:\n- Contains JSX syntax (angle brackets like `\u003cdiv\u003e`, `\u003cComponent /\u003e`)\n- OR is a React hook (uses `useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)\n\nIf a file is pure utility code (no JSX, no React imports), leave it as `.js`. Check each file before renaming.\n\n## Steps to Fix\n\nFor EACH file:\n\n1. Check if it contains JSX or React imports:\n   ```bash\n   head -20 src/hooks/usePrefetch.js\n   ```\n\n2. If it does, rename using git mv (preserves git history):\n   ```bash\n   git mv src/hooks/usePrefetch.js src/hooks/usePrefetch.jsx\n   ```\n\n3. After renaming, search for imports of the OLD path and update them:\n   ```bash\n   grep -rn \"usePrefetch\" src/ --include=\"*.jsx\" --include=\"*.js\" | grep \"import\"\n   ```\n   Note: Most bundlers (including Vite) resolve imports without extensions, so imports like `from \"../hooks/usePrefetch\"` will still work. But if any import includes the `.js` extension explicitly, update it to `.jsx`.\n\n4. After ALL renames, verify:\n   ```bash\n   npm run start\n   ```\n   Dev server should start without errors.\n\n## Verification\n\n1. All React files in src/ use .jsx extension\n2. Pure utility files (no JSX, no React) may keep .js\n3. Dev server starts without import resolution errors\n4. `find src/ -name \"*.js\" -not -path \"*/node_modules/*\"` returns only pure utility files (if any)","acceptance_criteria":"1.

In JavaScript, the string `\"false\"` is **truthy** (only empty string `\"\"` is falsy).\n\nThen on line 14:\n```jsx\nsetActive(!isActive);\n```\n\n`!isActive` flips `\"false\"` (truthy) to `false` (boolean). From that point on, the state alternates between boolean `true` and `false`. So the bug is: the initial value is a different TYPE than subsequent values. It works by accident because the component checks `!isActive` in the JSX, but it is a type error waiting to happen.\n\nAlso on line 43:\n```jsx\n{!isActive ? \u003cVscClose /\u003e : \u003cVscGrabber /\u003e}\n```\n\nWhen `isActive` is the string `\"false\"` (initial render), `!isActive` is `false`, so it shows `\u003cVscGrabber /\u003e`. This happens to be correct, but only by coincidence.\n\n## Steps to Fix\n\n1. Open `src/header/index.jsx`\n2.

The Vite equivalent is `import.meta.env`. Commit `05ee805` was titled \"fix: convert process.env to import.meta.env for Vite compatibility\" but this file was missed.\n\nNote: The `.js` version of this file (`src/utils/payloadApi.js` line 8) was correctly fixed and uses `import.meta.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`. Only the `.ts` version is broken.\n\n## IMPORTANT CONTEXT\n\nThis `.ts` file (687 lines) is NOT actually imported anywhere in the codebase. All 3 consumers import from `payloadApi.js` (the 202-line JS version). So this is dead code. However, since it exists and someone might use it in the future, fix it anyway.\n\n## Steps to Fix\n\n1.

Save the file.\n\n## Verification\n\n1. Search entire `src/` directory for `process.env`:\n   ```bash\n   grep -rn \"process\\.env\" src/\n   ```\n   Must return ZERO results from `.ts` or `.jsx` files (the comment in ghostApi.jsx mentioning it is fine).\n2.

It only exists as a transitive dependency of `payload` (the CMS backend). Rollup tries to create a chunk for it, cannot resolve it as an entry module, and the build explodes.\n\n## ALSO FIX (same file, same problem)\n\n**Line 64** — `manualChunks.cms` includes `payload`:\n```js\ncms: [\"payload\"]  // ← REMOVE THIS ENTIRE LINE\n```\n\nPayload CMS is a full Node.js backend server (Express, MongoDB, etc). It must NEVER be bundled into a client-side SPA. This was always wrong but the build failure on react-router-dom fires first, hiding this secondary bomb.\n\n## Steps to Fix\n\n1. Open `vite.config.js`\n2. Line 59: Change `vendor: [\"react\", \"react-dom\", \"react-router-dom\"]` → `vendor: [\"react\", \"react-dom\"]`\n3. Line 64: DELETE the entire `cms: [\"payload\"]` line\n4. Line 88: Change `include: [\"react\", \"react-dom\", \"react-router-dom\", \"framer-motion\"]` → `include: [\"react\", \"react-dom\", \"framer-motion\"]`\n5. Save the file\n\n## Verification (MUST PASS before closing)\n\nRun:\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nExpected:\n- Build completes with exit code 0\n- Output shows `✓ built in X.XXs`\n- A `build/` directory is created with `index.html` and `assets/` folder inside it\n\nIf the build STILL fails after your changes, do NOT close this issue.

{"id":"personal-site-fk2","title":"[P1] Clean up package.json — remove dead scripts and CRA/Node polyfill dependencies","description":"## Problem\n\n`package.json` has dead scripts from CRA, backend server dependencies that should not be in a frontend project, and 9 Node.js polyfill packages that CRA needed but Vite does not.\n\n## Part 1: Dead Scripts\n\nThese scripts reference tools that are not installed or no longer apply:\n\n```json\n\"test\": \"react-scripts test\",      // react-scripts is not installed\n\"eject\": \"react-scripts eject\",    // react-scripts is not installed\n\"predeploy\": \"npm run build \u0026\u0026 cp build/index.html build/404.html\",  // gh-pages workflow, not used\n\"deploy\": \"gh-pages -d build\",     // gh-pages is not installed\n```\n\n**Action**: Remove all four scripts. Replace `test` with a placeholder:\n\n```json\n\"test\": \"echo \\\"No tests configured yet\\\"\"\n```\n\nDelete `eject`, `predeploy`, and `deploy` entirely.\n\n## Part 2: CRA Browserify Polyfills (9 packages)\n\nCRA/Webpack automatically polyfilled Node.js built-in modules for the browser. Vite does NOT need these. These are all dead dependencies:\n\n```json\n\"assert\": \"^2.1.0\",\n\"browserify-zlib\": \"^0.2.0\",\n\"buffer\": \"^6.0.3\",\n\"constants-browserify\": \"^1.0.0\",\n\"crypto-browserify\": \"^3.12.1\",\n\"os-browserify\": \"^0.3.0\",\n\"path-browserify\": \"^1.0.1\",\n\"stream-browserify\": \"^3.0.0\",\n\"tty-browserify\": \"^0.0.1\",\n\"vm-browserify\": \"^1.1.2\",\n\"querystring-es3\": \"^0.2.1\",\n\"url\": \"^0.11.4\",\n\"util\": \"^0.12.5\",\n\"process\": \"^0.11.10\"\n```\n\n**Action**: Remove all 14 packages from `dependencies`.\n\n## Part 3: Backend-only Dependencies in Frontend\n\nThese are Payload CMS server dependencies. They belong in `package.backend.json` (which already exists), NOT in the main frontend package.json:\n\n```json\n\"@payloadcms/bundler-webpack\": \"^1.0.7\",   // Webpack bundler — project uses Vite\n\"@payloadcms/db-mongodb\": \"^1.7.5\",        // MongoDB driver\n\"@payloadcms/richtext-slate\": \"^1.5.2\",    // Slate rich text editor\n\"payload\": \"^2.32.3\",                      // Full CMS server\n\"express\": \"^4.18.2\",                      // HTTP server\n\"jsonwebtoken\": \"^9.0.2\",                  // JWT library\n\"dotenv\": \"^17.2.3\",                       // Env loader (Vite handles this)\n```\n\n**CAUTION**: Only remove these IF the frontend build does NOT import from them. Check first:\n```bash\ngrep -r \"from .payload\\|from .express\\|from .jsonwebtoken\\|from .dotenv\\|from .@payloadcms\" src/ --include=\"*.js\" --include=\"*.jsx\"\n```\n\nIf the grep returns results, do NOT remove those packages. Only remove the ones with zero frontend imports.\n\n## Part 4: Dead devDependencies\n\n```json\n\"source-map-explorer\": \"^2.5.3\",           // CRA bundle analyzer, replaced by rollup-plugin-visualizer\n\"node-loader\": \"^2.1.0\",                   // Webpack loader\n\"null-loader\": \"^4.0.1\",                   // Webpack loader\n\"@rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc\": \"^4.57.1\" // Windows-specific binary, should not be locked in\n```\n\n**Action**: Remove all four.\n\n## Part 5: Dead eslintConfig\n\n```json\n\"eslintConfig\": {\n  \"extends\": [\"react-app\", \"react-app/jest\"]\n}\n```\n\nThe `react-app` ESLint config is from CRA. Remove this entire block. If ESLint is wanted, it should be configured in a proper `.eslintrc` file.\n\n## Steps to Fix\n\n1. Open `package.json`\n2. Apply all changes from Parts 1-5 above\n3. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install`) to update the lockfile\n4. Run `npm run build` to verify nothing broke\n\n## Verification\n\n1. `npm install` completes without errors\n2. `npm run build` succeeds (after the vite.config fix is done)\n3. No `react-scripts` references in package.json\n4. No `browserify` or `*-browserify` packages in dependencies\n5. `npm ls --depth=0` shows a cleaner dependency tree","acceptance_criteria":"1.

{"id":"personal-site-nbk","title":"[P0] Fix require.context() calls — DynamicProjectPage still uses Webpack-only API","description":"## Problem\n\nFile: `src/components/DynamicProjectPage.jsx`\n\nThis file has TWO `require.context()` calls (lines 33 and 53). `require.context` is a **Webpack-only API**. It does not exist in Vite. This code will crash at runtime when the CMS API is unreachable and the fallback path is triggered.\n\nCommit `36928e3` was titled \"fix: convert require.context to import.meta.glob for Vite compatibility\" but this file WAS NOT FIXED. The commit message lied.\n\n## What require.context Does (so you understand)\n\nIt dynamically imports all `.json` files from a directory at build time. The Vite equivalent is `import.meta.glob`.\n\n## Current Broken Code (lines 30-48, appears TWICE)\n\n```jsx\nconst projectContext = require.context(\n  \"../content/projects\",\n  false,\n  /\\.json$/,\n);\nconst allProjects = {};\nprojectContext.keys().forEach((key) =\u003e {\n  const projectId = key.replace(\"./\", \"\").replace(\".json\", \"\");\n  allProjects[projectId] = projectContext(key);\n});\n```\n\n## Replacement Code\n\nReplace BOTH occurrences (lines 30-48 AND lines 52-68) with this pattern:\n\n```jsx\n// At the TOP of the file (outside the component), add this import:\nconst projectModules = import.meta.glob(\"../content/projects/*.json\", { eager: true });\n\n// Then inside the fallback logic, replace the require.context block with:\nconst allProjects = {};\nObject.entries(projectModules).forEach(([path, module]) =\u003e {\n  const projectId = path.replace(\"../content/projects/\", \"\").replace(\".json\", \"\");\n  allProjects[projectId] = module.default || module;\n});\n```\n\nKey differences:\n- `import.meta.glob` is declared at module level (top of file), NOT inside useEffect\n- The `{ eager: true }` flag loads them synchronously (same as require.context)\n- Glob paths use the actual filesystem path, not `./` relative paths\n- Each module might have its data on `.default` (ES module) or directly on the module object\n\n## Steps to Fix\n\n1. Open `src/components/DynamicProjectPage.jsx`\n2. Add this line AFTER the existing imports (around line 11):\n   ```jsx\n   const projectModules = import.meta.glob(\"../content/projects/*.json\", { eager: true });\n   ```\n3. Find the FIRST `require.context` block (around lines 33-42). Replace it with:\n   ```jsx\n   const allProjects = {};\n   Object.entries(projectModules).forEach(([path, module]) =\u003e {\n     const projectId = path.replace(/^.*\\//, \"\").replace(\".json\", \"\");\n     allProjects[projectId] = module.default || module;\n   });\n   ```\n4. Find the SECOND `require.context` block (around lines 53-62). Replace it with the EXACT same code as step 3.\n5. Save the file.\n\n## Verification (MUST PASS before closing)\n\n1. Run `npm run build` — must succeed (depends on vite.config fix being done first)\n2. Search the entire `src/` directory for `require.context`:\n   ```bash\n   grep -r \"require.context\" src/\n   ```\n   Must return ZERO results.\n3.

Multiple references to \"React Router\" throughout\n\n## What to Update\n\n### Tech Stack Section\nChange:\n```\n- **Frontend**: React, React Router, React Bootstrap, Framer Motion\n```\nTo:\n```\n- **Frontend**: React, TanStack Router, React Bootstrap, Framer Motion\n- **Build**: Vite\n```\n\n### Available Scripts\nReplace the scripts section with what actually exists in package.json:\n```bash\nnpm start        # Start Vite development server\nnpm run build    # Sync content + build for production\nnpm run preview  # Preview production build locally\n```\n\nRemove references to `build:analyze` and any CRA-specific scripts.\n\n### Project Structure\nUpdate to match the actual current directory layout. Key changes:\n- `src/app/routes.jsx` (not `routes.js`)\n- Components use `.jsx` extension (not `.js`)\n- Remove references to deleted files\n\n### General\n- Search for \"React Router\" and replace with \"TanStack Router\" where it refers to the client-side routing\n- Search for \"Create React App\" or \"CRA\" and replace with \"Vite\"\n- Remove references to `react-scripts`\n\n## Verification\n\n1. Read through the entire README and verify every claim matches reality:\n   - Every script mentioned exists in package.json\n   - Every file path mentioned exists on disk\n   - Every technology mentioned is actually used\n2.

{"id":"personal-site-wfj","title":"[P2] Extract hardcoded URLs into environment variables","description":"## Problem\n\nDomain URLs are hardcoded throughout the codebase instead of using environment variables. If the CMS domain, CDN domain, or blog domain changes, you have to grep-and-replace across 15+ files.\n\n## Hardcoded URLs Found\n\n| URL | Files Using It | Should Be |\n|-----|---------------|-----------|\n| `https://cms2.emmanuelu.com/api` | payloadApi.js, cmsWithFallback.jsx, payloadImageHelper.jsx | `import.meta.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` |\n| `https://cms2.emmanuelu.com` | payloadImageHelper.jsx, ProjectDetailPage example | `import.meta.env.REACT_APP_CMS_URL` |\n| `https://oculair.b-cdn.net` | videoProxy.js, serviceWorker.js, about/index.jsx, multiple project pages | `import.meta.env.REACT_APP_CDN_URL` |\n| `https://blog.emmanuelu.com` | SignupForm.jsx | `import.meta.env.REACT_APP_BLOG_URL` |\n\n## Steps to Fix\n\n### Step 1: Add new env vars to `.env.example`\n\nOpen (or create) `.env.example` and add:\n```env\nREACT_APP_API_URL=https://cms2.emmanuelu.com/api\nREACT_APP_CMS_URL=https://cms2.emmanuelu.com\nREACT_APP_CDN_URL=https://oculair.b-cdn.net\nREACT_APP_BLOG_URL=https://blog.emmanuelu.com\n```\n\nAlso add to the actual `.env` file (which is NOT tracked in git).\n\n### Step 2: Replace hardcoded URLs in source files\n\nFor each file, replace the hardcoded string with the env variable:\n\n**`src/utils/payloadApi.js`** — Already partially done (line 8 uses `import.meta.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`). Verify the fallback URL is correct.\n\n**`src/utils/cmsWithFallback.jsx`** — Line 149, replace:\n```jsx\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://cms2.emmanuelu.com/api/health\");\n```\nWith:\n```jsx\nconst apiUrl = import.meta.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || \"https://cms2.emmanuelu.com/api\";\nconst response = await fetch(`${apiUrl}/health`);\n```\n\n**`src/utils/payloadImageHelper.jsx`** — Line 23, replace the hardcoded CMS URL with:\n```jsx\nconst CMS_URL = import.meta.env.REACT_APP_CMS_URL || \"https://cms2.emmanuelu.com\";\n```\n\n**`src/utils/videoProxy.js`** — Line 15, replace CDN URL with:\n```jsx\nconst CDN_URL = import.meta.env.REACT_APP_CDN_URL || \"https://oculair.b-cdn.net\";\n```\n\n**`src/components/SignupForm.jsx`** — Line 12, replace blog URL with:\n```jsx\nconst BLOG_URL = import.meta.env.REACT_APP_BLOG_URL || \"https://blog.emmanuelu.com\";\n```\n\nFor **project page files** (VoicesUnheard.jsx, AquaticResonance.jsx, Branton.jsx, etc.) that have CDN URLs in JSX for images/videos — these are content URLs that come from the CMS data. They are harder to extract. At minimum, add a comment noting they are CDN-hosted content URLs. Ideally, they should come from the CMS data object, not be hardcoded.\n\n### Step 3: Verify\n\n```bash\ngrep -rn \"cms2.emmanuelu.com\\|oculair.b-cdn.net\\|blog.emmanuelu.com\" src/ --include=\"*.js\" --include=\"*.jsx\" | grep -v \"node_modules\" | grep -v \"// CDN content\"\n```\n\nShould return zero results (excluding comments you added for CDN content URLs in project pages).\n\n## Verification\n\n1.

{"id":"personal-site-y6x","title":"[P1] Consolidate duplicate source files — payloadApi, ErrorBoundary, LoadingSpinner, SkeletonLoader","description":"## Problem\n\nSeveral components and utilities exist in TWO places — a flat file in a parent directory AND a file inside a subdirectory. This creates confusion about which version is canonical. There is also a JS/TS duplicate of the API utility.\n\n## Duplicate 1: payloadApi.js vs payloadApi.ts\n\n- `src/utils/payloadApi.js` — 202 lines, plain JS, simple fetch. **THIS ONE IS ACTUALLY IMPORTED** (by DynamicProjectPage.jsx, portfolio/index.jsx, about/index.jsx).\n- `src/utils/payloadApi.ts` — 687 lines, TypeScript, with retry/cache logic. **NEVER IMPORTED. DEAD CODE.**\n\n**Action**: DELETE `src/utils/payloadApi.ts`. It is never used. If the retry/cache logic is wanted in the future, it can be re-implemented properly.\n\n## Duplicate 2: ErrorBoundary\n\n- `src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx` — 241 lines, has both `ErrorBoundary` and `CmsErrorBoundary`\n- `src/components/ErrorBoundary/ErrorBoundary.jsx` — Simpler version in subdirectory\n\n**Action**: Check which one is imported. Keep only the imported one. Delete the other. If both are imported by different files, consolidate into ONE location (prefer the subdirectory pattern: `ErrorBoundary/ErrorBoundary.jsx` with `ErrorBoundary/index.js` re-exporting).\n\nTo check which is imported:\n```bash\ngrep -rn \"ErrorBoundary\" src/ --include=\"*.jsx\" --include=\"*.js\" | grep \"import\"\n```\n\n## Duplicate 3: LoadingSpinner\n\n- `src/components/LoadingSpinner.jsx` — Flat file\n- `src/components/LoadingSpinner/LoadingSpinner.jsx` — In subdirectory\n- `src/components/LoadingSpinner/index.js` — Re-export (note: .js extension, should be .jsx for consistency)\n\n**Action**: Check which is imported. Keep only the subdirectory version (since it already has an index.js barrel file). Delete the flat file if nothing imports it directly.\n\n```bash\ngrep -rn \"LoadingSpinner\" src/ --include=\"*.jsx\" --include=\"*.js\" | grep \"import\"\n```\n\n## Duplicate 4: SkeletonLoader\n\n- `src/components/SkeletonLoader.jsx` — Flat file\n- `src/components/SkeletonLoader/SkeletonLoader.jsx` — In subdirectory\n\n**Action**: Same as above — check imports, keep the one that is used, delete the duplicate.\n\n## Steps to Fix\n\n1. For EACH duplicate pair above, run the grep command to find which version is imported\n2. Delete the unused version\n3. If any imports break, update the import path to point to the surviving file\n4. Rename `LoadingSpinner/index.js` to `LoadingSpinner/index.jsx` for consistency\n\n## Verification\n\n1.
