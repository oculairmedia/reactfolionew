I have an esteemed track record, having worked with startups, design agencies, and Fortune 500 companies, leading projects that resonate globally.

My portfolio showcases a commitment to this disciplined approach across web design, UX/UI, and interactive media projects, including pioneering work in immersive new media that combines digital video production with AI generative techniques.
