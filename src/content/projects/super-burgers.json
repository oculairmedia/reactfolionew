      "content": "Our journey began with an in-depth discovery phase, where we immersed ourselves in the world of fast food branding and Super Burgers & Fries' unique positioning. We conducted market research, analyzed competitor branding, and held multiple workshops with the client to understand their vision and values. The design process kicked off with extensive sketching and ideation. We explored various directions, from playful illustrated characters to bold typographic treatments. After several rounds of refinement, we landed on a concept that perfectly balanced boldness with approachability. The final logotype uses a custom-designed, bold typeface that emphasizes visibility and legibility, crucial for a fast-food brand. We integrated a subtle burger icon within the letterforms, achieving a seamless blend of text and symbol. The color palette, featuring vibrant yellows and reds, was carefully chosen to evoke feelings of energy and appetite appeal. We then expanded the visual identity across various touchpoints, including packaging, signage, and digital assets. Hand-drawn illustrations were created to add a layer of personality and storytelling to the brand materials.",
