      "content": "Liebling Wines, a virtual winery located in Niagara-on-the-Lake, approached us to create a brand identity that would reflect their unique approach to winemaking. The challenge was to develop a visual language that would pay homage to the proprietors' story, recognize the value of hard work and passion, and create an approachable, sustainable, and endearing aesthetic.",

      "title": "The Process",
      "content": "Our journey began with an extensive discovery phase, delving deep into Liebling Wines' history, production methods, and vision for the future. This involved multiple interviews with the proprietors, research into wine industry trends, and analysis of competitor branding. The design process started with conceptualizing a logomark that would encapsulate the essence of Liebling Wines. After numerous sketches and digital iterations, we landed on a stylized cornflower design. This choice acknowledges the role of earth and land in Liebling Wines' experience and product, while also nodding to the brand's historical roots in Germany. For the logotype, we developed a modern and playful spin on classic display serif fonts. This approach strikes a balance between tradition and innovation, reflecting Liebling Wines' respect for traditional winemaking methods and their forward-thinking approach to the industry. We then expanded the visual identity across various touchpoints, including bottle labels, packaging, and website design. The color palette and supporting graphical elements were carefully chosen to create a cohesive brand experience that feels both premium and approachable.",
