      "content": "Branton, a London-based design firm serving major industrial clients like McCormick and 3M, needed brand treatments that would resonate with their manufacturing audience while showcasing their design innovation. I was brought on to create visual identity pieces that balanced industrial strength with creative sophistication.",

      "title": "The Approach",
      "content": "I used Houdini's procedural capabilities to create dynamic brand treatments that embody precision and strength. The procedural approach allowed me to generate multiple variations while maintaining consistency—perfect for a firm serving diverse industrial clients.\n\nI developed a visual system using geometric forms and industrial materials as inspiration, creating animations and still frames that could adapt across applications. The procedural workflow meant I could quickly iterate and customize treatments for different contexts while keeping the core brand essence intact.",

      "title": "The Result",
      "content": "The final brand treatments successfully positioned Branton as both technically sophisticated and creatively innovative. The procedural approach delivered a flexible visual system that works across digital and print applications, from pitch decks to trade show materials.\n\nThe work helped Branton communicate their value to industrial clients: just as they bring design thinking to manufacturing, the brand treatments brought creative innovation to industrial aesthetics.",
