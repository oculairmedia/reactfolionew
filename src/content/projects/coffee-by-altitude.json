      "content": "Coffee by Altitude, a micro-roaster in Niagara Falls, approached us with a unique concept: focusing on beans grown at similar altitudes. Our challenge was to create a brand identity that would reflect this specialized approach while appealing to both coffee enthusiasts and process-driven consumers.",

      "title": "The Process",
      "content": "We began with an extensive discovery phase, diving deep into the world of coffee roasting and the significance of altitude in coffee production. We conducted interviews with the client, researched competitor brands, and explored various design directions that could effectively communicate the brand's unique selling proposition. The design process started with conceptualizing a logomark that would encapsulate the essence of Coffee by Altitude. After numerous sketches and digital iterations, we landed on a design that cleverly combines a coffee cup with altimeter markings, symbolizing the blend of science and passion in their curated blends. For the logotype, we chose an incised serif typeface, inspired by the complexity of Coffee by Altitude's techniques. This typeface adds a touch of sophistication while maintaining readability across various applications. We then developed a comprehensive brand identity system, including color palettes, typography guidelines, and packaging designs. The goal was to create a modern, technology-inspired design that would set Coffee by Altitude apart in the specialty coffee market.",
