      "title": "The Process",
      "content": "This project was a collaborative effort by Nyle Migiizi Johnston, Nigel Nolan, and Emmanuel Umukoro - members of Highness Generates, a division of Highness Global Inc. The process began with gathering datasets from Johnston's and Nolan's artwork, which Umukoro then used to create AI-generated imagery.\n\nThe objective during the creative process was to create a machine-generated collaboration of Johnston's and Nolan's work while employing Umukoro's extensive knowledge in animation and digital media. This unique approach allowed for a blend of traditional artistic styles with cutting-edge AI technology.\n\nThe team worked on creating a maximalist vision that incorporates patterns, colours, plant life, astronomy, and architecture into a new concept of a \"church\" for marginalized communities. This process involved multiple iterations of AI-generated imagery, careful curation, and skillful animation to bring the static images to life.",

It challenges traditional notions of religious spaces and invites viewers to consider more inclusive, diverse spiritual environments.",
