      "title": "The Process",
      "content": "This project was a collaborative effort by Nyle Migiizi Johnston, Nigel Nolan, and Emmanuel Umukoro - members of Highness Generates, a division of Highness Global Inc. The process began with gathering datasets from Johnston's and Nolan's artwork, which Umukoro then used to create AI-generated imagery.\n\nThe objective during the creative process was to create a machine-generated collaboration of Johnston's and Nolan's work while employing Umukoro's extensive knowledge in animation and digital media. This unique approach allowed for a blend of traditional artistic styles with cutting-edge AI technology.\n\nThe team worked on creating a maximalist vision that incorporates patterns, colours, plant life, astronomy, and architecture into a new concept of a \"church\" for marginalized communities. This process involved multiple iterations of AI-generated imagery, careful curation, and skillful animation to bring the static images to life.",

      "title": "The Outcome",
      "content": "The final video brings together a maximalist vision of patterns, colours, plant life, astronomy, and architecture into a new \"church\" for Indigenous, Queer, and POC folks. Voices Unheard: The Church and Marginalized Communities layers imagery of the future and thoughts from our past to bring the viewer into a space to contemplate new modes of creation, awareness, and unity.\n\nThis project showcases the potential of AI in creating immersive, thought-provoking art that addresses important social issues. It challenges traditional notions of religious spaces and invites viewers to consider more inclusive, diverse spiritual environments.",
