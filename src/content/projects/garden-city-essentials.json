The challenge was to create a more sophisticated and mature brand aesthetic that would reflect their reputation in the natural care space while honoring their history and core competencies.",

      "content": "We began with a comprehensive brand audit, analyzing Garden City Essentials' existing visual identity, market position, and customer perceptions. This involved in-depth discussions with the client, customer surveys, and competitive analysis. The design process started with exploring various concepts that could encapsulate the brand's eco-friendly ethos and handcrafted approach. After multiple iterations and client feedback sessions, we developed a new logo featuring a GCE monogram and leaf shapes, symbolizing the brand's history and core competencies. A key element of the new design is a single continuous stroke enclosed in a circle, representing harmony, handmade products, comfort, and care. This element became a central motif in the overall brand identity, appearing across various applications. For the logotype, we selected a complementary modern sans-serif typeface that balances well with the organic shapes in the logo. The color palette was refined to reflect a more sophisticated and mature brand image while still maintaining connections to nature and sustainability.",
