My involvement with the product extended beyond the digital surface; I embraced the possibilities of additive manufacturing to construct the initial product prototype.\n\nThis process not only expedited the development phase but also allowed for a seamless transition into creating marketing materials, leveraging the 3D models for visual consistency across all collateral. My tenure at Bin Metrics was marked by a harmonious blend of design, innovation, and strategic marketing, driving forward both the product and the brand.",
