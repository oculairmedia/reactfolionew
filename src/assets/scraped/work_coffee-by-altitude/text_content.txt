Coffee Roaster Visual Identity
Coffee by Altitude
Overview
Coffee by Altitude is a micro-roaster in Niagara Falls that focuses on beans grown at similar altitudes. The logomark combines a coffee cup with altimeter markings, symbolizing the blend of science and passion in their curated blends. The logotype uses an incised serif, inspired by the complexity of Coffee by Altitude’s techniques. The brand identity appeals to both coffee enthusiasts and the process-driven, and sets them apart with a modern, technology-inspired design.

“With Emmanuel’s cross-sectional expertise of design and business, the branding for Coffee by Altitude went as smoothly as I could have possibly hoped for. From the ideation, to the execution and then seeing my brand in situ for the first time, Emmanuel made every step of the project insightful and easy to undertake. I couldn’t be happier seeing my brand come to life.”
