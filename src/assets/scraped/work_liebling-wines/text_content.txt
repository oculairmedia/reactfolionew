Virtual Winery Visual Identity
Liebling Wines
Overview
Liebling Wines is a virtual winery located in Niagara-on-the-Lake, producing wines from carefully tended single vineyards. The logomark is a stylized cornflower, acknowledging the role of earth and land in Liebling Wines' experience and product, and nodding to the brand's historical roots in Germany. The logotype is a modern and playful spin on classic display serif fonts. The brand identity pays homage to its proprietors' story, and recognizes and honours the value of hard work, dedication, and passion. Its modern and playful design lend to an unpretentious aesthetic that is approachable, sustainable, and endearing.

“It was a pleasure working with Emmanuel as we developed our brand identity. Emmanuel was thorough in learning who we are, our goals, and our vision. He took the time to research ideas, and clearly presented the concept and rationale behind each visual asset. Emmanuel was communicative throughout the whole process, and truly passionate about our project from conception to delivery. We highly recommend Emmanuel for his professionalism, creativity, and business acumen.”
