Fast Food Visual Identity
Super! Burgers & Fries
Overview
Super Burgers & Fries is a fast food restaurant located in St. Catharines, offering fresh cooked smash burgers, French fries, ice cream, beer, and more. The logotype uses a bold and fun typeface that emphasizes visibility and legibility. Within it, the logomark is integrated seamlessly to achieve cohesion, scalability, and ease of use. Vivid colours and strong iconography, aided by hand-drawn illustrations, create an aesthetic that is simple, playful, and doesn't take itself too seriously. Super! Burgers & Fries' visual identity is loud, fun, and poised to stand above its competitors. Go on, check them out and have a bite.
