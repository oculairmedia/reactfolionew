Brewpub Visual Identity
The Merchant Ale House
Overview
The Merchant Ale House is a restaurant and brewpub in Downtown St. Catharines, known for offering fresh handcrafted beers and quality pub-style food. For over 20 years, it has been a beloved staple where locals gather and friends are made. Together we created a comprehensive brand identity that honors the restaurant's history and traditions, while positioning it as the go-to destination for grain-to-glass beers. Multiple lockups and variations are included to maximize the flexibility of visual elements in both digital and print mediums, and enhance the brand’s presence in all use-cases, large or small.
