Skincare & Wellness Visual Identity
Garden City Essentials
Overview
Garden City Essentials is an eco-friendly shop that offers small batch beauty and lifestyle goods. On their 5th anniversary, they asked me to elevate the brand's visual identity to reflect its sophistication and expertise. The new logo features a GCE monogram and leaf shapes, symbolizing its history and core competencies. A single continuous stroke enclosed in a circle represents harmony, handmade products, comfort, and care. The logotype is a complementary modern sans-serif typeface. The result is a more sophisticated and mature brand aesthetic that reflects its reputation in the natural care space, and is prepared to thrive for the next 5 years and beyond.
